QUESTION 8
----------
“401 Unauthorized” what does it mean and how to identify the problem?

Answer::
The HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) 401 Unauthorized response status code indicates that the client request has not been completed because it lacks valid authentication credentials for the requested resource.
This status code is sent with an HTTP WWW-Authenticate response header that contains information on how the client can request for the resource again after prompting the user for authentication credentials.
//Status
401 Unauthorized

//Example response
HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
Date: Wed, 21 Oct 2015 07:28:00 GMT
WWW-Authenticate: Basic realm="Access to staging site"


QUESTION 9
----------
“403 Forbidden” what does it mean and how to identify the problem?

Answer::
The HTTP 403 Forbidden response status code indicates that the server understands the request but refuses to authorize it.

This status is similar to 401, but for the 403 Forbidden status code, re-authenticating makes no difference. T
he access is tied to the application logic, such as insufficient rights to a resource.

//Status
403 Forbidden

//Example response
HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
Date: Wed, 21 Oct 2015 07:28:00 GMT

QUESTION 10
-----------
“404 Not Found” what does it mean and how to identify the problem?

Answer::
The HTTP 404 Not Found response status code indicates that the server cannot find the requested resource. Links that lead to a 404 page are often called broken or dead links and can be subject to link rot.

A 404 status code only indicates that the resource is missing: not whether the absence is temporary or permanent. If a resource is permanently removed, use the 410 (Gone) status instead.

//Status
404 Not Found

//Custom error pages
You can display a custom 404 page to be more helpful to a user and provide guidance on what to do next. For example, for the Apache server, you can specify a path to a custom 404 page in an .htaccess file:

ErrorDocument 404 /notfound.html


QUESTION 11
-----------
“500 Internal Server Error” what does it mean and how to identify the problem?

Answer::
The HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) 500 Internal Server Error server error response code indicates that the server encountered an unexpected condition that prevented it from fulfilling the request.

This error response is a generic "catch-all" response. Usually, this indicates the server cannot find a better 5xx error code to response. Sometimes, server administrators log error responses like the 500 status code with more details about the request to prevent the error from happening again in the future.

//Status
500 Internal Server Error


QUESTION 12
-----------
“502 Bad Gateway” what does it mean and how to identify the problem?

Answer::
The HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) 502 Bad Gateway server error response code indicates that the server, while acting as a gateway or proxy, received an invalid response from the upstream server.
//Status
502 Bad Gateway


QUESTION 13
-----------
“503 Service Unavailable” what does it mean and how to identify the problem?

Answer::
The HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) 503 Service Unavailable server error response code indicates that the server is not ready to handle the request.

Common causes are a server that is down for maintenance or that is overloaded. This response should be used for temporary conditions and the Retry-After HTTP header should, if possible, contain the estimated time for the recovery of the service
Caching-related headers that are sent along with this response should be taken care of, as a 503 status is often a temporary condition and responses shouldn't usually be cached.

//Status
503 Service Unavailable


QUESTION 14
-----------
“504 Gateway Timeout” what does it mean and how to identify the problem?

Answer::
The HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) 504 Gateway Timeout server error response code indicates that the server, while acting as a gateway or proxy, did not get a response in time from the upstream server that it needed in order to complete the request.
//Status
504 Gateway Timeout

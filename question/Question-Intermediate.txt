QUESTION INTERMEDIATE
=====================

QUESTION 1
----------
Assume we have an application that is designed as below. Our application stopped
responding due to an extremely high number of clients in some circumstances.
- We have tried scaling a number of API Gateway and Service A nodes but it didn’t help.
What are the possible problems that lies in our system in which components and how
to fix them?
Answer::



QUESTION 2
----------
How do you keep the docker image smallest as possible?
Answer::
1. Squash multiple layers into one with multi-stage Docker builds
When a Git repository becomes bigger, you can choose to squash the history into a single commit and forget about the past.
It turns out you can do something similar in Docker too with a multi-stage build.

2. Remove all the unnecessary cruft from the container with distroless
The current image ships Node.js as well as yarn, npm, bash and a lot of other binaries.
It's also based on Ubuntu. So you have a fully fledged operating system with all its little binaries and utilities.

3. Smaller base images with Alpine
You could replace the distroless base image with an Alpine based image.


QUESTION 3
----------
How does the Kubernetes service talk to each other in the same cluster?
Answer::



QUESTION 4
----------
What’s different between L2, L4, and L7 Load balancers? When to use it?
Answer::
- The advantages of Layer 4 Load Balancing
Suitable for packet-level balancing of loads
It is quick and efficient because it does not take data into account.
Because packets are not examined, they are more secure. If it is compromised, no one will be able to access the data.
It just forwards the packets. It does not need to decrypt the content before forwarding.
NAT is used.
Maintains only one NATed connection between the client and the server, allowing your load balancer to serve a maximum number of TCP connections.

- The disadvantages of Layer 4 Load Balancing
Based on the content, smart load balancing is not possible.
Cannot perform true microservices.
Because it is a stateful protocol, it must be sticky. When a connection is established, it is routed to a single server in the backend.
All packets sent through this connection are routed to a single server. Based on the algorithm, the next connection will select another server.

- The advantages of Layer 7 Load Balancing
Based on the URL, it provides smart routing.
It offers caching.

- The disadvantages of Layer 7 Load Balancing
It is expensive.

When to use it?
L4
When a connection is established, it is routed to a single server in the backend.
All packets sent through this connection are routed to a single server. Based on the algorithm, the next connection will select another server.
L7
In terms of security, your certificate must be shared with the load balancers. If an attacker gains control to the load balancer, 
they will have total access to all of your data.
Its proxy establishes several connections — client to proxy/proxy to server — so you are limited by the load balancer’s maximum TCP connection.


Decryption is required.
